# Deep4Rec

Popular Deep Learning based recommendation algorithms built on top of TensorFlow served on a simple API.

## What is Deep4Rec ?

Deep4Rec is a high level API that serves popular Deep Learning based recommendation algorithms as black box models. The models are built on top of TensorFlow 1.10.0 using Eager mode.

## What is not Deep4Rec?

Deep4Rec is not a general purposes framework for trying new approaches and models to recommender systems.

Deep4Rec is not affiliated to the official TensorFlow project in any way.

## Why Deep4Rec?

Deep4Rec was developed mainly to accelerate research by providing a way for researchers to use previously proposed models as black boxes.
